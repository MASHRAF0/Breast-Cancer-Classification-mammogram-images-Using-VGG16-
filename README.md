# Breast-Cancer-Classification-mammogram-images-Using-VGG16-
We'll work with the VGG16 architecture, using weights that have been trained in ImageNet. We'll walk through three different ways to use its architecture and fine-tune it to be used for classification of dense vs. fatty breast tissue on mammogram images (Betweem Dense, and fatty ).
